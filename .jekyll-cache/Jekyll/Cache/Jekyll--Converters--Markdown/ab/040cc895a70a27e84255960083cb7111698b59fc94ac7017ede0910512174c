I"2<p>I was, admittedly, a bit nervous to complete this assignment because it involves
a little more code than I’m used to as a humanities concentrator. However, I soon
realized that the XML and TEI were not to be feared and I set about going through
<a href="https://dpul.princeton.edu/pudl0017/catalog/qr46r491g">Thomas Adam’s Journal</a> to find a page that I could tag.
When I came across this page, which is embedded below, I decided that it was perfect
for my purposes. I wanted a page with a few different entries, so that I would have some
variety.</p>
