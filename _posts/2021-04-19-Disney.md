title: Making A Disney Star
---

## Initial Thoughts
  For this project, I chose to go with option B, looking at a specific era of film and television. I chose to look at Disney Studios specifically, rather than a specific genre, because of the *unique* influence that Disney has held over the American public, popular culture, and the creation of celebrity and stardom in the United States (and the world more widely as well), especially on Gen Z. For the project, I looked specifically at Disney-made film and television shows from 2001 to 2015. Because Disney Studios is so encompassing, I focused on "Disney Originals" for the movies from this period and exlcuded cartoon and animated movies. Having grown up as a part of the generation that lived with these movies and shows, I was interested in seeing how the shows or movies depicted the use of actors in the Studios. My thoughts were that there would arise two main points. Firstly, that the creation of celebrity was key for the development of Disney and Disney sought to create, rather than nurture and maintain, stardom. Thus, they would be responsible for the the creation of pop culture, but not be made to ensure it. Secondly, I also wanted to see how interconnected Disney Studios itself actually is. By looking at their actors and their projects, I hoped to see overlap, creating a distinct "community" of Disney actors.
