title: Making A Disney Star
---

## Initial Thoughts
  For this project, I chose to go with option B, looking at a specific era of film and television. I chose to look at Disney Studios specifically, rather than a specific genre, because of the *unique* influence that Disney has held over the American public, popular culture, and the creation of celebrity and stardom in the United States (and the world more widely as well), especially on Gen Z. For the project, I looked specifically at Disney-made film and television shows from 2001 to 2015. Because Disney Studios is so encompassing, I focused on "Disney Originals" for the movies from this period and exlcuded cartoon and animated movies.
