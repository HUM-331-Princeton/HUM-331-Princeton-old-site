## Sources

I am interested in exploring private forms of communication (diaries, letters, etc.) from the [Western Americana Collection](https://dpul.princeton.edu/pudl0017). In particular, I am curious about women's perspectives on exploration and settlement in the Western United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Most of the written materials in the collection were produced by men, especially those surrounding exploration. I found one manuscript (pictured below) written by Nellie Martin Wade titled "Through Interior Alaska on Horseback and the Scenic Coast Route" on her exploration of Alaska in the early 20th century. Notably, Wade includes in the title page that she is the "first woman to explore the Great Shushitna Valley and the Mt. McKinley Range."

Other documents written by women in the collections include:
* [A letter between two sisters, sent from California to New York in 1855](https://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/C1446/c13)
* [A letter from a daughter to her mother, sent from Colorado in 1884](https://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/C1446/c26)
* [A letter from a Lakota woman, written in Lakota with an attached translation](https://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/C1446/c23) 

Unlike Wade's manuscript, these documents do not depict exploratory journeys. Nevertheless, they can provide inside into the experiences of women's daily lives in the American West, a historical region whose history I often associate with male miners/farmers. Additionally, I would note the inclusion of some written documents on Native American life, though it appears that most of the written materials in the collection represent settlers' perspectives. 

## Methods

One category of digital tools that interests me are those that deal with geographic data. This is particularly relevant when looking at records of traveling and of journeys, which center heavily around location. Tools such as StoryMap and TimeMapper seem especially appropiate for this task, as they allow for the combination of media and location-specific information. The physical hsitory of the Western Americana collection (much of it focuses on journeys to the Pacific and traveling to various states in the West) lends itself especially well to tools that connect places with texts. I would also be interested in tools that provide new ways to display or interact with handwritten text, though I am not sure what tools exist in this category.

## Purpose and Challenges

I would hope viewers of this project could gain a new perspective and insight on women's experiences expressed through their private communications. Though I will likely end up working with a different set of sources, through this project I would hope to (in some way) illuminate the experience and writing of indivudals who are not commonly represented in their historical context. 

One challenge I anticipate with this project is supplementing documents in the digital collections with other external research, especially as there may be little or no information about the authors of these documents besides the documents themselves.
Another concern I have is navigating the scope of the project - there is clearly a depth of information found in just one document and I am interested to see how far the final project will "reach."
