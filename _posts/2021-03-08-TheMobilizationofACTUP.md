## Introduction

In thinking about mapping and what maps can reveal to a reader, my thoughts kept centering around the physical use and acessibility of space (or lack thereof). Activism and advocacy, as redefined by ACT UP and the AIDS activism movement, centered itself around the usage of space, often creating, finding, invading spaces in order to bring awareness to the issues at hand. New York City, a city which simulatenously unites and sgregates, acted as one of the main places for ACT UP demonstrations and actions through the '80s and '90s - the other being Washington D.C. Entering spaces, such as the Wall Street or the New York Stock Exchange, which were not made for marginalized identities, or public places like Central Park, meant for public consumption rather than political revolution, becomes a transgressive and radical act. ACT UP embraced this mentality and sought to shake up people's perceptions through their activism. In this way, ACT UP was able to target pharmaceutical comapnies and other corporations that profited from the AIDS epidemic as well as hold the government accountable for its lack of response.

Thus in this mapping project, I sought to use StoryMaps to present a narrative through which a reader could see the development of ACT UP demonstrations by the powerless in spaces made for the powerful.

## Sources

For this project, I heavily referenced the ACT UP historical archives and its [chronology of ACT UP demonstrations](https://actupny.com/actions/) in the 1980s and '90s. The archives recount many of the actions that ACT UP undertook and their resaoning and goals for each. I also drew from an [NPR article](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/02/09/689924838/how-to-demand-a-medical-breakthrough-lessons-from-the-aids-fight) recounting a partial history of the ACT UP movement and its major moments.

In addition to these ACT UP histories, I also used the US National Library of Medicine exhibit titled [Surving and Thriving: AIDS, Politics, and Culture](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/survivingandthriving/index.html). The exhibit contains many images from various demonstrations, including the protest against the National Institute of Health (to which the Library of Medicine belongs).
